00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.360
You're waiting that maybe there's some
problem with the camera, but yeah, no.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.120

dd6dd691-b1fa-4f94-b177-ea2d93c3d807-0
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.400
Yeah, let's start.

c26239f7-74b1-4526-8dc8-35ba5aa8fa56-1
00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:06.840
we have discussed in the last week like
we have placed the button for the refresh

c26239f7-74b1-4526-8dc8-35ba5aa8fa56-2
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.040
on the listing screen as well as the
estimation screen so that you guys

c26239f7-74b1-4526-8dc8-35ba5aa8fa56-3
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.280
whenever if it is in the queue.

6bffa416-06cf-4801-a686-53114b3b55c8-0
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.000
So you can click on that and then system
will showcase the status, the AI status.

43270065-5562-4f07-9273-182444f1d6eb-0
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.240
And then we are showing the pop up toast
message.

dd2c0545-e0d1-48b7-bfe9-efd44e716a8b-0
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.160
Whenever you uploading a document then it
will showcase that message.

17b9819d-f385-4117-bc5c-4fc336f791d2-0
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.585
And if you hit the refresh button,
it will showcase the same if it is in

17b9819d-f385-4117-bc5c-4fc336f791d2-1
00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:35.000
progress or success or whatsoever.

aa6e6325-dc17-4bba-a1f1-60c91228fa61-0
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.400
And then we have added one column on the
listing screen for the AI status.

ab87fcda-89c1-4de7-8496-224cd3b86727-0
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.137
So it will showcase the success in
progress,

ab87fcda-89c1-4de7-8496-224cd3b86727-1
00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:48.640
all those stuff so that you no need to
again click on the refresh button.

7d5a9b92-755e-42c2-8a6a-98e815c7a042-0
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.645
And apart from that currently we if we
uploading any document and then the

7d5a9b92-755e-42c2-8a6a-98e815c7a042-1
00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:59.118
system is able to face those information
from the AI back end and showcase on the

7d5a9b92-755e-42c2-8a6a-98e815c7a042-2
00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:00.120
listing screen.

22f64590-7ad3-4168-9d6f-ca35f1408abc-0
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.440
So that's we have done from our link.

3b09421d-4cb7-492f-8171-1e8e6efb4852-0
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.020
So if we are ready,
then we can share our screen and then

3b09421d-4cb7-492f-8171-1e8e6efb4852-1
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.000
create one opportunity,
upload the document and then see.

32212616-454f-4ea3-a341-de21c89b1fc5-0
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.960
Yeah, we're Jay.

272bdc2d-6502-4258-b87c-bd35b0c0fe87-0
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.100
Yeah, we've been,
we've been ready for about a month and

272bdc2d-6502-4258-b87c-bd35b0c0fe87-1
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.240
1/2.

89918642-5ce9-46c7-942e-6b4f12e19b01-0
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.480
So I think you could say we're ready.

bbbcbeaf-821a-4b9c-b104-d6975e8f9238-0
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.080
Yeah, yes.

26407ed5-bdb0-406b-b016-1f2d24c9678a-0
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.520
OK, so let's start.

b1fdcf87-0841-4f1a-b3c5-7f523968315a-0
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.200
Hope the screen is visible.

132ad202-237c-4fa0-ab97-9ca1e7b5d30c-0
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.200
Yep, it is.

d1898991-22d0-4d53-a72d-32509dfa0bad-0
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.680
Let me add a opportunity finished.

7e2e2fe5-6528-4de6-8f29-7efed54b7050-0
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.420
OK, so here it is.

48535805-3786-4f13-b5fd-e4ca615a8a92-0
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.820
Let me upload a document over here.

3f06ccb6-8fb0-4711-ba6d-b81cda5c14e3-0
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.680
Yes.

6f09fd73-2abd-4984-8e83-40e4d3d28968-0
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.880
So I was talking about this particular
column.

178691b4-e981-4753-9a8a-43ed91c3954a-0
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.487
So we are added this,
we are added this one AI status and here

178691b4-e981-4753-9a8a-43ed91c3954a-1
00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:44.040
is the refresh button.

2eeb63e0-1a90-4f1e-a331-4c9fed81b838-0
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.520
So currently it is in progress.

b5017863-7114-48b4-a62a-dc620c2f0dea-0
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.103
So if you hit the refresh button,
it will update the AI status and showcase

b5017863-7114-48b4-a62a-dc620c2f0dea-1
00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.720
on the listing screen.

3e11bee0-e404-426c-a88a-9fb03cce403b-0
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.720
So we have loaded the document on this.

5240503b-7aee-4960-bec2-1b6e10af436b-0
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.440
So let's wait for a couple of minutes and
then we can.

94ce4e05-3373-4b2c-b448-9e4672c1fd49-0
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.188
So meanwhile you can look at the other
estimate that you guys tested yesterday,

94ce4e05-3373-4b2c-b448-9e4672c1fd49-1
00:06:08.188 --> 00:06:08.960
this morning.

c1b0bf4d-2306-4d54-bb08-3c760ecbc34f-0
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.280
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

643c1187-9110-4491-81b4-5d7d1b1f869a-0
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.880
Let me duplicate the tab.

e6abc4e7-9e68-4d16-bc1c-009ecd0210a7-0
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.040
Yeah.

84ccd53e-cc29-4521-8afa-dca66ec25ea0-0
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.840
So what we have done estimation.

898e4d8f-a497-499d-9d50-cf3c26742f9b-0
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.400
So the time at which you had sent it was
34, right?

4b65c3aa-e4a1-4c90-b500-1c11c912ee1a-0
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.600
Yes, yes, yes.

d30129f4-b42c-4cb2-afd2-0f5991e5ee6a-0
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.320
OK, here it is.

dc08e37d-c58d-478f-bcd3-3aabfc27c0be-0
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.960
See 204 the system time it is showing not
the our timing.

b758efec-5a3b-4d23-ad5a-8e30d07dc9d2-0
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.320
Sure, no problem.

98d315b8-1efc-40a6-9196-aebb9a537da9-0
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.040
OK, 205 only one minute.

c046167f-8d6b-41bb-bdb3-d59e24c8dfcf-0
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.640
Yeah.

f0f310b6-f531-4702-adb3-663aae489b0e-0
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.200
So we have done this thing.

e2bb236c-dbd7-4d12-96eb-3396e5408c7d-0
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.960
So the system is showing the result for
all these 10 estimation.

baeacbf0-916e-45e6-b714-5f4d3efce219-0
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.040
Yeah, it's looking better.

415b959c-d80d-40f1-a7e7-69484577a0d5-0
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:19.880
Yes, looking better, 1048 hours, yeah,
yes.

10162c83-4d43-4e2a-87ec-f6b260f634ef-0
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.154
And for some of the items,
the material and labor,

10162c83-4d43-4e2a-87ec-f6b260f634ef-1
00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:27.120
maybe not accurate.

8ff3a81e-3703-48a4-b42c-d19adc008ace-0
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.954
Then again,
we need to like whenever you guys are

8ff3a81e-3703-48a4-b42c-d19adc008ace-1
00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:33.319
checking the information,
then you guys let us know just so that we

8ff3a81e-3703-48a4-b42c-d19adc008ace-2
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.200
can accommodate those things from out.

804d654f-4f35-437b-b0f4-c5c8cdcb57a4-0
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.840
Yeah, like, like we said last week,
it's OK that these numbers are wrong.

b8055265-d077-4096-8dfd-c9e87ca9cd58-0
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.269
You know,
we we're not going to go to fix them

b8055265-d077-4096-8dfd-c9e87ca9cd58-1
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:46.240
until they actually show up.

fc9890aa-57b1-40a6-a441-a05f89506b7e-0
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.061
So, yeah,
so now at least we have numbers to look

fc9890aa-57b1-40a6-a441-a05f89506b7e-1
00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:58.775
at then we can diagnose what rules or
whatever that are sort of pointing in the

fc9890aa-57b1-40a6-a441-a05f89506b7e-2
00:07:58.775 --> 00:08:00.800
wrong place, correct.

709313df-fa68-4791-b7e8-121af565cb97-0
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.560
So I, I have like already click on that.

30b71ecb-937c-42c6-bbe4-6fe83603ea61-0
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.960
That is why it is showing design uploaded
list gates successfully.

b9189193-ad47-4610-8ba8-73c2a37662ac-0
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.542
So once that's been done,
the AI status will change from in

b9189193-ad47-4610-8ba8-73c2a37662ac-1
00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:19.440
progress to success if we if it is faced
all the information from the AI document.

d738eb4b-300f-4dc8-812b-f77b59f78edd-0
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.480
So let's wait for a few more minutes.

71547376-9454-4441-be5d-756c8d91231a-0
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.960
So as of now 3 minutes.

c893d3e0-26c6-40b5-b7ce-7a94d087fb0c-0
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.993
And I also looked at the system status
yesterday with Jitendra yeah,

c893d3e0-26c6-40b5-b7ce-7a94d087fb0c-1
00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:43.430
Ajay Arpesh yesterday evening.

eaef4770-d102-4c0f-8678-05eb533680c3-0
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.817
And I think we have uploaded almost like
4 to 5 different document one by one, yes,

eaef4770-d102-4c0f-8678-05eb533680c3-1
00:08:49.817 --> 00:08:52.870
and it was going through the process
right.

25ad20a6-a544-46a2-9b86-c9393c276592-0
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.550
When document is processed,
second is processed, right?

1bac2595-724d-4d4c-af62-85752f6f2e46-0
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.320
And then we're able to see the proper
data as well, right?

99b39da8-4daa-4b98-9f34-c7eb95f83690-0
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.840
That description is coming up,
the hours cost, they're all coming up.

504dd9a8-428b-4f8b-a369-04f8d17a4762-0
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.631
So I would say now system is at the stage
where you guys can start testing it,

504dd9a8-428b-4f8b-a369-04f8d17a4762-1
00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:11.080
right?

a4189777-e055-4d7f-bf47-a77fa6458311-0
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.703
And then look at the data,
verify and then start sharing your

a4189777-e055-4d7f-bf47-a77fa6458311-1
00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:17.520
feedback.

92037d02-b800-4440-990f-c377f6c63675-0
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.560
Yeah, definitely, yes.

308787fc-91fc-4e84-b95a-9ea6d96e72fd-0
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.960
And one question for please.

78b7221f-ab62-434f-8b7a-5f07ca4fd8d0-0
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.320
So sorry, sorry, ask a question.

730d74ff-61c0-4580-b361-b5cfec9a7adb-0
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.400
Yes.

7f592be3-f336-4467-9b24-d436e1b05619-0
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.320
So have you updated those a questionnaire
from your increase?

bc419984-a437-4b0f-87e4-15b16b57c73c-0
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.200
No, I have.

e03fdc54-9b0c-4136-b1d7-72179bd27d2e-0
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.977
No,
I haven't added in the the pipe schedule

e03fdc54-9b0c-4136-b1d7-72179bd27d2e-1
00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:37.200
one.

1f9e308a-e4f8-40aa-8143-38e0923cf017-0
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.360
I haven't because I have checked and it
was blank at that point.

4f4c7dee-eb29-41f1-a155-98ba213d7ed7-0
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.641
Like whatever information is there still
the same information and and have you

4f4c7dee-eb29-41f1-a155-98ba213d7ed7-1
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:53.050
created that particular table or
different,

4f4c7dee-eb29-41f1-a155-98ba213d7ed7-2
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:58.320
different material from where we could
phase the made from details?

f9361c72-6e28-47e9-8c35-9770491057f0-0
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.280
Yeah, the the sheet sizes.

09541aaa-65a3-455d-bc0a-90b7af84b62b-0
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.200
Yeah, I have that I thought I'd yeah, yes.

6ade2213-4752-47e5-8081-c9d9d6fb1a8a-0
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.080
So it's been succeed.

7f54b305-ee45-44f0-b3e7-849dff98a7c0-0
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.520
So it took around approximately 4 minute.

a5d678c2-edd7-4afc-a7c4-511f640d5665-0
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.000
We have uploaded document 24 and it's
been 2-9.

e07075cd-2e5d-49bb-8576-6e9521a1e5a2-0
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.960
OK, 4 to 5 minutes now.

7dd03ac6-396b-4bac-bdac-3dd54c4e808e-0
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.160
Yeah, I did have a question.

a5a3deb7-abbe-4d5e-8b13-7c5ad4582629-0
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.550
So during that four or five minutes when
the machine was working,

a5a3deb7-abbe-4d5e-8b13-7c5ad4582629-1
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.360
what exactly what exactly was it doing
there?

03df3381-4378-4302-a44c-4d35b6fb7db2-0
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.000
OK, what exactly?

e2098087-194a-4b31-a89f-8e1a3e93f5a9-0
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.720
Smith, over to you.

a34cc8b6-1e7f-4938-81c7-70ca1dcb12b7-0
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.160
So it splits onto multiple parallel
processes.

dd2c23d2-5df1-47b4-8c2a-6f7074c3af3e-0
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.349
One process is extracting basic
information,

dd2c23d2-5df1-47b4-8c2a-6f7074c3af3e-1
00:10:45.349 --> 00:10:50.773
not basic but critical information such
as what type of tank it is,

dd2c23d2-5df1-47b4-8c2a-6f7074c3af3e-2
00:10:50.773 --> 00:10:55.560
was the joint efficiency values,
shell diameters, etcetera.

003ffed9-5fc1-42b6-a51d-cf80366fb1f3-0
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.644
And then once it fetches those details,
it helps the back end team to basically

003ffed9-5fc1-42b6-a51d-cf80366fb1f3-1
00:11:00.644 --> 00:11:04.920
understand what the labour cost,
hours and all of those stuff should be.

47367761-dc53-4b2e-9a5c-45095f8b7587-0
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.920
And then it also processes the line items
1 by 1.

e5af3006-c46c-4e5c-8945-00470f6149b0-0
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.842
So regardless of whether you're uploading
an 80 page document, 200 page document,

e5af3006-c46c-4e5c-8945-00470f6149b0-1
00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:18.369
rather than passing all pages,
we actually extract,

e5af3006-c46c-4e5c-8945-00470f6149b0-2
00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:22.440
let's say the 20 to 30 relevant pages
from those documents.

d5f89dd9-3fce-48c0-8264-b68f09d98cb7-0
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.206
Because of which we're able to crunch
down the time and we determine which

d5f89dd9-3fce-48c0-8264-b68f09d98cb7-1
00:11:28.206 --> 00:11:32.923
pages to select via an intelligent
algorithm purely depending on the

d5f89dd9-3fce-48c0-8264-b68f09d98cb7-2
00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:37.640
keywords of pages that are most critical
to the AI model to process.

0cb48933-3108-455b-8594-39585bc1845d-0
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.608
And after that it crunches all those
numbers and gives the line items back to

0cb48933-3108-455b-8594-39585bc1845d-1
00:11:41.608 --> 00:11:44.400
the back end team,
which they then display on the front end.

d8ab3165-2717-42be-bdbe-3b4b5440923f-0
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.975
And once the backing team receives this,
they then use the internal mappings they

d8ab3165-2717-42be-bdbe-3b4b5440923f-1
00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:54.760
have to your master tables to derive
these additional material labour costs.

f3e8d2c8-8096-42e6-a319-9781de272920-0
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.448
All right, OK, So the,
the application is basically taking a,

f3e8d2c8-8096-42e6-a319-9781de272920-1
00:12:01.448 --> 00:12:08.645
in this case it's like a 50 page file and
it's looking through it and over the

f3e8d2c8-8096-42e6-a319-9781de272920-2
00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:14.840
course of four minutes figuring out which
12 pages it needs, right?

63cb53fb-193f-45c1-b9ab-382659d8de58-0
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.480
Tosses out other 28 pages, right?

8a275dfd-f3bb-4303-adda-8d1325b3d32a-0
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.784
You take the 12 pages and then extracts
the relevant information about shell

8a275dfd-f3bb-4303-adda-8d1325b3d32a-1
00:12:25.784 --> 00:12:31.560
thickness, number of courses,
nozzle schedule, anchorage and so forth.

a814e749-9c11-4154-bf6d-0d9fe7ec360d-0
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.680
All that, right?

c6428b60-1c66-45ef-af9c-3c88db6a627f-0
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.361
And then passes that to a,
a back end mapping algorithm that says,

c6428b60-1c66-45ef-af9c-3c88db6a627f-1
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:44.360
OK, if I'm looking at a top,
here's what I put out.

d1dba36d-0eb5-4b1d-941b-a685456c74f4-0
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.333
And here's what if I'm looking at a
bottom or a cone or whatever,

d1dba36d-0eb5-4b1d-941b-a685456c74f4-1
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.640
I'm looking at the rim angle.

adcc7eaa-411b-4688-b89e-687a70af0baa-0
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.040
Here's what I here's what I display on
this grid.

855a93cf-db24-4473-a199-e3982479adf5-0
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.600
Is that right?

dbfbbf63-5b0d-4f3f-b20b-21f1b309a40c-0
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.680
Correct.

5d5c72eb-a0c4-47a7-8426-93a7f3e878f5-0
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.427
And even within it,
to break it down even further,

5d5c72eb-a0c4-47a7-8426-93a7f3e878f5-1
00:12:56.427 --> 00:13:00.762
for the line items,
it's extracting anywhere between 65 to

5d5c72eb-a0c4-47a7-8426-93a7f3e878f5-2
00:13:00.762 --> 00:13:02.600
250 different components.

0ba1f28e-cd5c-4590-9c54-62f2b06e4241-0
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.615
Because for each item it extracts,
it extracts the name and then it extracts

0ba1f28e-cd5c-4590-9c54-62f2b06e4241-1
00:13:07.615 --> 00:13:12.694
the specifications which includes the MOC
code description which contains the width

0ba1f28e-cd5c-4590-9c54-62f2b06e4241-2
00:13:12.694 --> 00:13:17.712
and any other metric value that needs to
be mentioned in the format you require it

0ba1f28e-cd5c-4590-9c54-62f2b06e4241-3
00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:18.680
to be mentioned.

787288b3-b865-401c-8e6c-dfb6497b881a-0
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.920
The format which you currently follow.

30159ff2-b3f2-4d59-8219-27b88e1fd68f-0
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.518
So when you times it,
but by let's say 8 or 15 components,

30159ff2-b3f2-4d59-8219-27b88e1fd68f-1
00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:31.087
you get anywhere between 150 to 200 plus
components that's being crunched in these

30159ff2-b3f2-4d59-8219-27b88e1fd68f-2
00:13:31.087 --> 00:13:36.120
4 minutes and all of them are being
passed to the back end simultaneously.

bf5844b1-6cf1-4515-bced-5eadaeb829b4-0
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.360
OK, all right, so, so let let me ask.

0070ccea-0c9d-4052-a2a4-df826b9113f7-0
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.080
So the the one sort of area of concern I
have.

c6e1502f-6c20-4e27-b656-226f8b9af49f-0
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.238
So Halen,
maybe you can put my mind at ease at this

c6e1502f-6c20-4e27-b656-226f8b9af49f-1
00:13:44.238 --> 00:13:45.360
on this reference your way.

d52727d2-ab98-4321-a898-eceb5862497b-0
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.155
So if,
if we're starting out with 40 pages or 50

d52727d2-ab98-4321-a898-eceb5862497b-1
00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:51.400
pages or one day, maybe 300 pages.

f799df5e-be33-49b0-97e0-0482f618f82d-0
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.481
And the model is the,
the application is taking out all

f799df5e-be33-49b0-97e0-0482f618f82d-1
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:58.324
irrelevant pages, which is what we do,
by the way,

f799df5e-be33-49b0-97e0-0482f618f82d-2
00:13:58.324 --> 00:14:02.672
we flip through these things and we know
what page to go to and we ignore the

f799df5e-be33-49b0-97e0-0482f618f82d-3
00:14:02.672 --> 00:14:04.400
other sort of 90% of the pages.

f6eda2b3-5fa8-4a6b-bae2-923a7b94bbcb-0
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.240
How, how do we know that?

30acc8d1-3e51-46bc-a9da-7605c519c939-0
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.363
I mean sort of so,
so when these calculation files are

30acc8d1-3e51-46bc-a9da-7605c519c939-1
00:14:13.363 --> 00:14:16.835
generated by the application,
in this case AME tank,

30acc8d1-3e51-46bc-a9da-7605c519c939-2
00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:22.076
but in the case of a pressure vessel,
it's, you know, it's compressed the, the,

30acc8d1-3e51-46bc-a9da-7605c519c939-3
00:14:22.076 --> 00:14:26.203
the, the application,
those calculation applications don't pay

30acc8d1-3e51-46bc-a9da-7605c519c939-4
00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:29.544
any attention to what information is on,
you know,

30acc8d1-3e51-46bc-a9da-7605c519c939-5
00:14:29.544 --> 00:14:34.720
the top of a page or the middle of a page
or the bottom of a page or whatever.

250433b1-5bae-4b2d-b878-47e79476234a-0
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.039
And if sometimes, you know,
things start on one page and then flip

250433b1-5bae-4b2d-b878-47e79476234a-1
00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:43.294
over to another next page and it doesn't
care, OK, The, the, the,

250433b1-5bae-4b2d-b878-47e79476234a-2
00:14:43.294 --> 00:14:47.355
the outputs don't take any consideration
for whether you know,

250433b1-5bae-4b2d-b878-47e79476234a-3
00:14:47.355 --> 00:14:52.320
half of your information that you need is
on the last, last line of page 12.

ad6bdd31-f789-444e-bb99-b298f6f6ac63-0
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.062
And,
and this sort of carries over to the

ad6bdd31-f789-444e-bb99-b298f6f6ac63-1
00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:56.080
first line of page 13.

90d408d2-956a-4530-b1a6-f5a1c1227d24-0
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.360
It makes no discrimination against that.

8aed3272-4d36-48e2-bae1-b1d2e1401fab-0
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.654
How, how do you, how do we know Sahel,
that in a case where some pivotal

8aed3272-4d36-48e2-bae1-b1d2e1401fab-1
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:11.040
information is sort of straddling 2 pages,
how do we know we get everything?

e9811953-ef71-4237-92fc-4932090f04d0-0
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.680
OK?

4152e988-e21f-42f4-9e75-6891dd58d01e-0
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.840
So we prompted the model heavily, right?

60700271-4bc0-47d5-b921-cf254efe63a0-0
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.184
And based off the domain clarification
sessions we've had with Chris,

60700271-4bc0-47d5-b921-cf254efe63a0-1
00:15:21.184 --> 00:15:25.280
as well as the initial discovery sessions,
we prompted the model.

06526981-0d0b-47cd-91ba-5c8b9e6c39a6-0
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.531
So the exact thinking process,
I can't tell you verbatim because AI is

06526981-0d0b-47cd-91ba-5c8b9e6c39a6-1
00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:33.364
sort of a least a large language model,
is sort of a black box,

06526981-0d0b-47cd-91ba-5c8b9e6c39a6-2
00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:35.880
so you can't visualize every hidden layer.

427e4068-5a77-4638-9de5-8d392e2039e1-0
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.783
However,
we have enforcings in place and we refer

427e4068-5a77-4638-9de5-8d392e2039e1-1
00:15:39.783 --> 00:15:44.400
to the table of contents to ensure that
no page is overlooked.

08011f01-4759-4713-bd17-013f2222cc16-0
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.028
Even if the content goes over to the next
page,

08011f01-4759-4713-bd17-013f2222cc16-1
00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:53.120
we adhere to the page number structure
defined in the table of contents.

60ebcc35-c764-44b2-8ec0-532d9eaa929c-0
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.120
This way we don't skip out any pages.

2149064f-b5bb-4ebc-9c4d-6783e676cda8-0
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.258
But ultimately,
it's difficult to give you the exact

2149064f-b5bb-4ebc-9c4d-6783e676cda8-1
00:15:59.258 --> 00:15:59.960
explanation.

402de5fd-5c85-4d29-adfd-c0a31b1f1db6-0
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.240
This is the logic that the AI model is
following.

1aa7e1d3-b9bf-4e15-a571-f40986a9b26f-0
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.288
Yeah,
You understand my question basically,

1aa7e1d3-b9bf-4e15-a571-f40986a9b26f-1
00:16:05.288 --> 00:16:08.115
which is,
let's just say we got a nozzle schedule

1aa7e1d3-b9bf-4e15-a571-f40986a9b26f-2
00:16:08.115 --> 00:16:11.000
and there's 12 nozzles and the 1st 11 are
on page.

4dc630bc-46e5-4543-936d-1ba6b0c08110-0
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.800
You know, I'll just make up this thing.

a1a853cc-9e0d-467f-92d9-ea13e44fa67e-0
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.040
They're on page 40,
but the last one is on page 41.

d2236636-975e-442d-9edf-7a911e94c30b-0
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.720
Yeah, right.

104581cc-182e-4eee-9c53-53d70d0e37c7-0
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.720
AME tank or compress,
they don't care that it ships.

158a245b-49de-4df4-9215-ac2efc165ad3-0
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.320
It is that this grid is not all on one
page.

0423aec9-ac2b-413f-bc5b-ac032aabf3e5-0
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.200
It doesn't care.

9ad6dc3e-c47a-44d1-9d5e-7b0de8f41025-0
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.200
Yeah.

447c7127-ee98-4b25-a4e6-4fe5dc27d9c4-0
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.462
So what we do is let's say in your table
of contents you've written down nozzle

447c7127-ee98-4b25-a4e6-4fe5dc27d9c4-1
00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:39.120
schedule is page 40 and then the
subsequent title is at page 41.

7fe59cdc-502a-4972-89f4-0466d7a3f2f8-0
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.320
While we're considering nozzle schedule,
we'll consider page 39, page 40, page 41.

7807c993-bf62-4925-8264-f247ea2b5fc1-0
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.400
OK.

4695276d-f13b-4813-b8e5-2cf71df18f58-0
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:45.840
All right.

ad1450f6-882a-46bd-bd2f-f4d934a96af5-0
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.480
OK.

4c1aca5c-8bb8-4fb1-94f3-53c32a25112d-0
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.760
Does that answer your question, David?

19c92945-f833-4363-8fa8-0f0ab6fd3894-0
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.960
We have got I guess in other words,
we have a high degree of confidence.

5fd23608-aa1c-4547-bb93-5ac4abfdf435-0
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.079
So hail that everything,
all the components that are on the tank

5fd23608-aa1c-4547-bb93-5ac4abfdf435-1
00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:00.994
that are listed in those in that
calculation,

5fd23608-aa1c-4547-bb93-5ac4abfdf435-2
00:17:00.994 --> 00:17:05.240
they're all going to be here when we go
to look for them, correct?

484782d7-5851-41ce-8cff-67c9af8e93cd-0
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.040
Yeah.

21b2032c-5d5f-46e9-a982-a0035f74f208-0
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.483
And I think if, if there are,
if there are any scenarios or or age

21b2032c-5d5f-46e9-a982-a0035f74f208-1
00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:18.068
cases, right,
that is not covered in the prompt

21b2032c-5d5f-46e9-a982-a0035f74f208-2
00:17:18.068 --> 00:17:21.951
engineering,
I think we should be able to identify,

21b2032c-5d5f-46e9-a982-a0035f74f208-3
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:22.400
right.

d0be84e1-dae2-4851-a2e5-c6d06c3893c1-0
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.616
When we go through,
let's say this is situation one I'm

d0be84e1-dae2-4851-a2e5-c6d06c3893c1-1
00:17:25.616 --> 00:17:30.040
considering, we will have some feedback,
right, on the descriptions component.

04a8f00e-3104-4319-9c6f-c85ad904dc25-0
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.243
We will have the feedback from Chris on
the material cost and the labour hours

04a8f00e-3104-4319-9c6f-c85ad904dc25-1
00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:36.360
calculation, right?

16c808c7-9ad1-40bc-ae6e-e3b11b15cce4-0
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.880
So that's something we will take away,
right?

c3feffce-4a66-48f9-af4e-fb6ca867456c-0
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.405
We will look at prove that logic again,
come back to iteration 2 and maybe if

c3feffce-4a66-48f9-af4e-fb6ca867456c-1
00:17:43.405 --> 00:17:47.200
there's anything then we can cover that
into iteration 3 as well.

8281c55e-1dee-4c8e-a83d-4dfcea97b947-0
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.021
But that's why we need to look at like
possible scenario majority parties is is

8281c55e-1dee-4c8e-a83d-4dfcea97b947-1
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:54.680
already covered as a part of the current
design.

7d4d24d1-ebb5-4c0a-bf22-30bb6a711cba-0
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.400
Yeah.

65c665f6-cf09-45d7-ab26-6ac320b5be15-0
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.639
And as I mentioned in the work call on
Monday,

65c665f6-cf09-45d7-ab26-6ac320b5be15-1
00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:05.030
right that still we are looking at the I,
I was assuming it's 25,

65c665f6-cf09-45d7-ab26-6ac320b5be15-2
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:10.911
but Ajay corrected me yesterday that
Shakti it is more than 4548 small,

65c665f6-cf09-45d7-ab26-6ac320b5be15-3
00:18:10.911 --> 00:18:13.279
small tables, mapping tables.

c30ac945-2a13-4d97-a7b1-75dc9b2159a8-0
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.548
So I will,
I will use the new numbers 48 tables like

c30ac945-2a13-4d97-a7b1-75dc9b2159a8-1
00:18:17.548 --> 00:18:20.800
for material cost and the labor
calculation.

dd41f33b-5720-4087-890a-7e17a429a23f-0
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.320
So that is still going on.

2e32a405-80d3-4ab6-be7f-20df7e6ba6b7-0
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.766
Maybe some of them need to look at making
sure that nothing is overlooked in terms

2e32a405-80d3-4ab6-be7f-20df7e6ba6b7-1
00:18:27.766 --> 00:18:28.800
of the data mapping.

bf122a35-24db-4c69-a7a3-e649e769fa1e-0
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.040
It's not related to code, API or AI.

de0d3234-4fdd-49e3-956d-698449259ccb-0
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.080
It's just purely logic rules, right,
That we need to work on the data.

b87f8248-9ce5-49ae-8beb-33fcea794009-0
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.920
That's it.

ef0370d3-70d3-4f5a-849d-b7d4400757b7-0
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:39.960
Yeah.

414c17c8-0847-4bc9-a4f0-fb0cb5f250d1-0
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.429
OK, so, so let me ask that doctor,
you know,

414c17c8-0847-4bc9-a4f0-fb0cb5f250d1-1
00:18:44.429 --> 00:18:50.305
so when we look at the outputs here,
which is great, now we're going to have,

414c17c8-0847-4bc9-a4f0-fb0cb5f250d1-2
00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:54.147
you know,
a model here we can start to look at and

414c17c8-0847-4bc9-a4f0-fb0cb5f250d1-3
00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:55.879
put to the test, right.

9c58dc0b-e70b-4240-a6a3-fb48a60e5fa9-0
00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.641
And when we find that the model has done
something wrong and this, you know,

9c58dc0b-e70b-4240-a6a3-fb48a60e5fa9-1
00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:04.042
800 hours for something that should be
like, you know,

9c58dc0b-e70b-4240-a6a3-fb48a60e5fa9-2
00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:07.320
20 hours or something like that,
What what do we do?

90860e4d-9343-4f3f-9faf-3d58826c0678-0
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.240
What, what, what do we do then?

4f350ecb-79f6-4f11-b092-49f7ad26590c-0
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.120
Yeah.

67920b6f-5768-4ff8-9d69-49fbb40d40ac-0
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.982
So I think we we have a template where we
normally ask to capture those feedback

67920b6f-5768-4ff8-9d69-49fbb40d40ac-1
00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:23.049
that we have used this designed document
and specific this component,

67920b6f-5768-4ff8-9d69-49fbb40d40ac-2
00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:27.971
right as per the document,
we should be having this number of hours

67920b6f-5768-4ff8-9d69-49fbb40d40ac-3
00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:30.360
or this cost, which is incorrect.

617135a9-360c-40aa-bb71-08ceb36bbe6c-0
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.938
So if you have that detail right with the
reference of the document design document

617135a9-360c-40aa-bb71-08ceb36bbe6c-1
00:19:35.938 --> 00:19:37.480
and we will look at that.

6a998b29-122f-42fa-b6c5-095fd984012e-0
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.817
So Ajay,
let's let's share that feedback document

6a998b29-122f-42fa-b6c5-095fd984012e-1
00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:47.862
right after this call so that can be
looked at and we can use that our, our oh,

6a998b29-122f-42fa-b6c5-095fd984012e-2
00:19:47.862 --> 00:19:50.280
say Teams, right, shared folder.

603a7b52-f387-4a9f-a88d-8829d30a748d-0
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.280
And we will use document over there.

6a445bf5-bce9-4867-ab95-9ceba971dfa0-0
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.640
So you can access or just a thought as we
already have a note, right?

0e3e6976-52b7-43ce-9483-2cf4a2cd1617-0
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.581
So while reviewing that particular
document,

0e3e6976-52b7-43ce-9483-2cf4a2cd1617-1
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:08.735
a user could easily update anything over
here only and then they could save the

0e3e6976-52b7-43ce-9483-2cf4a2cd1617-2
00:20:08.735 --> 00:20:10.120
entire estimation.

89ac55e9-7757-4db1-8224-8891db280bbb-0
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.000
And from there we could review the
information.

70569adf-192e-488f-93de-e5de353b46e9-0
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.360
No need to go here.

762fe89d-dc29-4103-8020-ae26058bb5ae-0
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.680
No, no, no, that, that's the system,
right?

d93aa076-9a21-41f7-b275-c35e3287275b-0
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.360
We need to capture the feedback, right?

b857161f-157e-4749-a3e9-7e12958cb58a-0
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.474
If there's more than one item problem and
we need to record those feedback as well,

b857161f-157e-4749-a3e9-7e12958cb58a-1
00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:25.840
right?

6a8e7524-7253-4851-a35c-9490d1996653-0
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.419
So we can look at whether it's something
that can be quickly fixed and we can

6a8e7524-7253-4851-a35c-9490d1996653-1
00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:32.440
provide update tomorrow or something.

aa3bcf51-c880-4474-8fa2-b19799239d17-0
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.560
It will take long, right?

16d19756-6db4-4f9d-8e49-8e7154ffe803-0
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.080
So let's let's use our standard template.

6da69d56-7502-4f8a-a343-66947664239c-0
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.240
Yeah, OK.

bd219de6-3204-4939-a366-1cf74b8a38e0-0
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.120
And then we will put that into a group.

e8e44b4d-8374-4fbc-bfbe-777506ab8ff2-0
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.255
So anyone can use that,
update it and then we can look at time to

e8e44b4d-8374-4fbc-bfbe-777506ab8ff2-1
00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:45.560
time.

078fc899-c856-4747-9215-a1412e6ef0af-0
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.760
Yeah, in a structured way.

d2a9428e-2d68-42d7-ae15-da024febc80e-0
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.080
Yep.

80476d0a-55eb-4353-91f7-b4fb28100dde-0
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.720
So now David from here,
this version is updated on UAT enrollment.

904d991c-ccb7-430e-a02e-7a33654ddd4f-0
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.226
So you should be able to access it from
today onwards,

904d991c-ccb7-430e-a02e-7a33654ddd4f-1
00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:02.160
right now for developing team as a next
step.

1d0da3a2-af95-49ed-a11e-ff23fe0afafa-0
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:09.360
What I was thinking that yes,
we have ASME, we have storage tank, right?

928b8214-f35f-409a-a5ab-e55d0c7b1f2e-0
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.920
Those take we need to look at.

ce4448a7-49c9-46bb-9110-b30f3c99e93c-0
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.144
But what I want to do,
we have two to three items still remain

ce4448a7-49c9-46bb-9110-b30f3c99e93c-1
00:21:16.144 --> 00:21:17.040
on API tank.

104732f9-c42c-4724-90e1-57c37b33f541-0
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.027
Things like if I make any change in the
description that I want to recalculate,

104732f9-c42c-4724-90e1-57c37b33f541-1
00:21:23.027 --> 00:21:26.308
right,
the specific line item for material cost

104732f9-c42c-4724-90e1-57c37b33f541-2
00:21:26.308 --> 00:21:27.880
or labour hours, right?

31376f67-6ff4-46b2-b9a5-f45a835986f6-0
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.720
And again, I want to save this estimate.

b4ac86b3-1b08-4dc6-9fc8-7406393519c8-0
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.694
If I want to create a new estimate
version,

b4ac86b3-1b08-4dc6-9fc8-7406393519c8-1
00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:36.920
then I should be able to create a new
estimate version.

7c47c9c9-f791-4e94-b26d-26f588e60c15-0
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.840
So some of the features are still in
development, right?

60422590-1325-4617-8efc-4de1ab5f2932-0
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.560
So we want to complete that in next
couple of days.

4d0728e6-e648-4465-92fe-22deeae64095-0
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.560
We will give you exact timeline when that
version is available, right?

8c02a15f-539c-418c-80a7-3445d493c4a6-0
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.910
So meanwhile you guys review provider
feedback,

8c02a15f-539c-418c-80a7-3445d493c4a6-1
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.760
we will take those item plus we will move
forward with the development as well.

5d0dc557-1718-40cc-abff-ec57c99e11b2-0
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.360
And once it is done,
we will actively write,

5d0dc557-1718-40cc-abff-ec57c99e11b2-1
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.720
look at and give you a timeline about the
other three tank.

93f938fd-f6bd-469d-9ce9-94030c010e06-0
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.160
Yeah, but it is not gonna be in a month.

3aadd0b1-12f6-42c3-8119-35632f3a849f-0
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.437
It will be,
I would say a week or or two week right

3aadd0b1-12f6-42c3-8119-35632f3a849f-1
00:22:08.437 --> 00:22:09.320
down the line.

eee486ef-f5b8-4311-ab87-63b45de07991-0
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.120
Yeah.

e78e90fa-2ea3-4752-91ba-2faa68212261-0
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.410
So in terms of prioritization, Shakti,
yeah,

e78e90fa-2ea3-4752-91ba-2faa68212261-1
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:23.915
the team's priority now to get the ASME
pressure vessel sort of type of tank

e78e90fa-2ea3-4752-91ba-2faa68212261-2
00:22:23.915 --> 00:22:32.863
working or to improve the functionality
and accuracy of the storage tank the the

e78e90fa-2ea3-4752-91ba-2faa68212261-3
00:22:32.863 --> 00:22:34.520
API tank, yeah.

563703d8-2216-4495-8cce-ac94a8674b4d-0
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.550
So improving the functionality and
accuracy,

563703d8-2216-4495-8cce-ac94a8674b4d-1
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.120
we will have that point parallel to the
development.

f0aa104b-13bb-4b30-9007-3aa18c38e4d2-0
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.068
And I think we just need to agree that if
you want me to focus on ASME and presser

f0aa104b-13bb-4b30-9007-3aa18c38e4d2-1
00:22:47.068 --> 00:22:50.120
vessels,
we can take those tank on a priority.

355a3323-bf42-457e-b22f-c923975ae64c-0
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.817
Then we need to just have agreement that
OK,

355a3323-bf42-457e-b22f-c923975ae64c-1
00:22:53.817 --> 00:22:57.107
there is feature called new estimate
version,

355a3323-bf42-457e-b22f-c923975ae64c-2
00:22:57.107 --> 00:23:02.470
there's a feature I want to edit this
line item and recalculate the labour

355a3323-bf42-457e-b22f-c923975ae64c-3
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.400
hours, right?

53216387-2cce-47bd-b995-6d9a29e2ba17-0
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.040
So we will do that later.

b202a42f-62d6-4f6f-af4f-3a4c0cff9992-0
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.680
But I think that is important.

0911b6ee-aa45-4237-be89-30944b80d337-0
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.920
It is, it is a small point.

9dd08132-1387-4c54-b70a-f7daad3fa66a-0
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.360
It's not going to take let's say a week
or two week, right.

6e1c3fbf-5990-44b1-a106-58d55b683f63-0
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.447
But creating a new version,
I can put it to a,

6e1c3fbf-5990-44b1-a106-58d55b683f63-1
00:23:16.447 --> 00:23:20.967
let's say a second priority,
but changing the line item,

6e1c3fbf-5990-44b1-a106-58d55b683f63-2
00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:26.518
changing the material code and
calculating the right price and hours,

6e1c3fbf-5990-44b1-a106-58d55b683f63-3
00:23:26.518 --> 00:23:30.880
we need to take it right now before we go
to the tank.

09aa46de-238b-4e08-8cba-3747a0b74db6-0
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.200
What do you think?

6880b82a-09ab-4366-bf20-f3d89156e6f8-0
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.697
So Because when we look at when we look
at when we look at the estimate, right,

6880b82a-09ab-4366-bf20-f3d89156e6f8-1
00:23:39.697 --> 00:23:45.252
the minimum operation I would see is
uploading the document, seeing the data,

6880b82a-09ab-4366-bf20-f3d89156e6f8-2
00:23:45.252 --> 00:23:45.680
right.

0edd307e-2cd1-4e9f-bca3-b20a4d8b2596-0
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.280
Next step is verify the accuracy if any
problems right report.

98c8036b-746b-44dd-bf3a-8fd78c43335b-0
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.160
So we will work on that definitely as a
priority.

d579f8d5-db4c-429c-9dec-5418a1e2c5f3-0
00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:01.840
One second, yeah, continue shot,
you're good.

c9436805-c328-461f-9770-f36b1ed4601e-0
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.320
Yeah.

799b7ec1-d0a4-40ab-846a-d3e6a14fc19b-0
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.173
And and 2nd now when I look at to how
that complete estimate,

799b7ec1-d0a4-40ab-846a-d3e6a14fc19b-1
00:24:06.173 --> 00:24:10.847
maybe I need to update the description,
maybe I need to update the material code,

799b7ec1-d0a4-40ab-846a-d3e6a14fc19b-2
00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:13.640
maybe I need to recalculate the cost and
labour.

7ff59478-670b-4f60-9609-fd22870e9ad0-0
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.800
So that is something minimum I need to
look at, right?

905d1796-3cf5-4dd4-95e0-4ff7ab342db1-0
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.205
The Third Point I see in the bottom part,
we have all the numbers and calculation

905d1796-3cf5-4dd4-95e0-4ff7ab342db1-1
00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:23.280
and formulas, right?

ad6d621c-40b7-477e-afd7-0055d79a07d1-0
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.080
So that's something we should have.

d168efa8-96fd-46a2-8556-cd7d5675fe93-0
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.960
So when I look at those 3 component which
is accuracy, right?

6f451ed2-b740-48e9-b469-9073488b56dd-0
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.184
Second,
updating the description and recalculate

6f451ed2-b740-48e9-b469-9073488b56dd-1
00:24:32.184 --> 00:24:37.645
that line item and the bottom encryption,
that will make my one estimate complete,

6f451ed2-b740-48e9-b469-9073488b56dd-2
00:24:37.645 --> 00:24:38.040
right?

f7695da9-5c1f-4d1a-abf9-f65dc8859137-0
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.000
And then we look at the ASAP and press
the vessels.

2b83222a-559d-429b-a2a3-f533a953fc01-0
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.286
Everything we're learning on the API
though is,

2b83222a-559d-429b-a2a3-f533a953fc01-1
00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:50.880
is going to correlate over to ASME,
correct.

07fd5ee4-bf3d-49d5-8dae-55e46ae97b44-0
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.640
Like it's not 100%, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4adf5e4f-f802-4d6c-adfd-d3e380cf02d0-0
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.120
We are not doing anything from scratch
for ASME or preservation, right.

4fd645a2-8033-4a61-9e18-4deec8d96e46-0
00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.760
And I would say the majority more than
60% work is already done, right.

74db21eb-6438-4db7-a022-9545ac88e56c-0
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.109
But again,
I don't want to write raise an

74db21eb-6438-4db7-a022-9545ac88e56c-1
00:25:06.109 --> 00:25:10.195
expectation here,
but I want to give you a version what we

74db21eb-6438-4db7-a022-9545ac88e56c-2
00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:14.974
are looking at today, right,
properly that Chris now ASM is ready or

74db21eb-6438-4db7-a022-9545ac88e56c-3
00:25:14.974 --> 00:25:16.360
SMS is ready, right.

c779a019-b126-4362-8ecb-02a8066f61c8-0
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.760
So you guys can take it further.

d2391bf1-7247-4080-bb44-42f1b6c71a30-0
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.040
I would prefer to just work on the API.

d707a66c-785f-407b-a430-e4b7138a9216-0
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.447
That's where I'm at too get it,
get it to a point where I'm actually

d707a66c-785f-407b-a430-e4b7138a9216-1
00:25:27.447 --> 00:25:27.840
using it.

9216c2e5-1e7a-496c-9443-6cbc0cac9a1d-0
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.320
Yeah.

4f8f2032-9775-4f8e-abae-98ee2f91e432-0
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.840
And then and and we're looking at minimum,
minimum function that we need it, right?

ee5f5262-dbbf-4c63-9770-405c5fba19a6-0
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.960
Let's say creating a new estimate version,
right?

f8887699-0d66-47f8-aae2-fdd342cdec4c-0
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.560
Maybe we'll definitely put into second
priority, right.

b1fba3f7-dad5-4f49-9c60-8f5cf080a55b-0
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.400
But we need a version where we can work
with it.

86a114be-bfc4-4464-9944-910ed77b59df-0
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.861
So we have that right and let's let's
look at the small chunk that is remedy so

86a114be-bfc4-4464-9944-910ed77b59df-1
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:47.200
we can make it complete.

1bbb748b-007a-4af4-b311-8cbf426e068d-0
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240
So it is usable.

83e04355-ce1d-44f0-90e5-3b8292a4501b-0
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.440
That that what I meant.

73fa0e3e-6116-4eb8-b560-e77ac17dda54-0
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.880
Yeah, yeah, I I would agree, yeah, yeah.

84a0cc79-3f18-4068-8f30-1d4e76e8bdc1-0
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.240
On the same page in terms of
prioritization of resources.

c9f1deea-7dd8-4708-ae8c-83a4daac3d32-0
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.075
So let's now Shakti, you know,
make sure that your team is working with

c9f1deea-7dd8-4708-ae8c-83a4daac3d32-1
00:26:04.075 --> 00:26:11.443
Chris and Nick and Shannon or whatever to
and through the accuracy of what this API

c9f1deea-7dd8-4708-ae8c-83a4daac3d32-2
00:26:11.443 --> 00:26:15.040
version is giving us so that it's usable.

e4659685-2e2e-47d2-bc04-2b18ece7f9fb-0
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.840
Yep.

04cd030c-ca15-43b2-a0ab-4753719a7ec2-0
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.080
As soon as as soon as we can make it.

a2e45ff7-7bd7-4eb7-b27b-b839c89c8486-0
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:25.080
That means that the ASME part needs to
drag behind by two or three weeks.

0120d55c-03e2-4f5f-849c-480ec7e2b3d0-0
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.720
Well, that's fine.

e841062f-d3d4-4247-a392-e07987a36d5f-0
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.440
We'll live with that.

d25377e3-375f-4c0e-bb93-8879639200d1-0
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.800
Yeah, No, no, that's what I meant, right?

916f4690-d50a-4778-b383-3096acdb5fc8-0
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.221
That we want to have like something that
is now usable and focus on the accuracy

916f4690-d50a-4778-b383-3096acdb5fc8-1
00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:37.480
and whatever we do right that will also
reusable for the other thing as well.

0dbc8b4b-bd99-47d3-82d7-5ba040b080c9-0
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.189
So we do we're not doing right that from
scratch and we are looking at another

0dbc8b4b-bd99-47d3-82d7-5ba040b080c9-1
00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:41.800
three months.

f1ed7899-8e3e-4141-a0db-fe686255efd1-0
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.856
That's not going to happen right Is there
is nowhere is a use case that we're

f1ed7899-8e3e-4141-a0db-fe686255efd1-1
00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:46.400
looking at.

3f09ea24-3732-4a0c-a9e3-ec7a4bc9be57-0
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.400
Yeah.

c8281b03-7bfd-4fbc-9420-9b8223184c11-0
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.358
OK, so I'll,
I'll have a call with after this with the

c8281b03-7bfd-4fbc-9420-9b8223184c11-1
00:26:51.358 --> 00:26:54.160
team making sure that we are on the same
page.

e7a8e788-a364-438e-a8ca-54a8f06ffe83-0
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.712
And we will have 2 member,
one from the data side,

e7a8e788-a364-438e-a8ca-54a8f06ffe83-1
00:26:58.712 --> 00:27:01.480
one member from the EA side, right.

267f8ed3-cefe-40e3-8a32-d41a4e474647-0
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.120
They will be available to work on it with
Chris Rick and any feedback we received.

ce81049a-8736-4470-8d51-b4ba07e8ce73-0
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.800
Then actively they will look at and give
you the update that at the same time we

ce81049a-8736-4470-8d51-b4ba07e8ce73-1
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.800
will have arrangement where we are
progressing on the development as well.

1ff8170a-f44d-4b9d-8903-7622832dba54-0
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.120
So that's something I will look at yeah.

3ccc6b54-3375-46f5-9642-09c95e5bcceb-0
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.049
Can we go back Ajay to the to the
application and and you know,

3ccc6b54-3375-46f5-9642-09c95e5bcceb-1
00:27:23.049 --> 00:27:28.148
look at some of the output there,
the particularly like the cone top or a

3ccc6b54-3375-46f5-9642-09c95e5bcceb-2
00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:30.560
flat bottom or something like that.

910cb13c-3de7-4c2e-a39a-b8d22de39b30-0
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.190
All right,
So let me just have a look here.

57c97e4d-0828-4981-b481-b1b821ce59f0-0
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.002
OK, so let me ask, you know, I I don't,
you know,

57c97e4d-0828-4981-b481-b1b821ce59f0-1
00:28:02.002 --> 00:28:04.520
see on here the diameter of the tank.

7b366aba-0970-4d4a-929a-854b7690faa8-0
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.400
So yeah,
I was actually thinking about that when

7b366aba-0970-4d4a-929a-854b7690faa8-1
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.840
he was flipping through him.

e304204e-0428-4661-a5e6-21dc0ae91190-0
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.540
You know,
we don't have that information on the

e304204e-0428-4661-a5e6-21dc0ae91190-1
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.080
screen.

7ff63ac1-a085-4e66-b746-df76149a3d4e-0
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:13.760
Yeah.

1173570d-12a5-4f32-bd72-ec9313a8fd34-0
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.588
It would be good to have up here
someplace and you guys can't see where

1173570d-12a5-4f32-bd72-ec9313a8fd34-1
00:28:18.588 --> 00:28:22.209
I'm pointing,
but over top of the material dollar and

1173570d-12a5-4f32-bd72-ec9313a8fd34-2
00:28:22.209 --> 00:28:25.428
labor hours,
it'd be good to have like a little

1173570d-12a5-4f32-bd72-ec9313a8fd34-3
00:28:25.428 --> 00:28:30.995
description box or whatever that tells us
the diameter and the shell height of the

1173570d-12a5-4f32-bd72-ec9313a8fd34-4
00:28:30.995 --> 00:28:31.800
of the tank.

48a5286b-511b-41bd-b915-f4df35dd5386-0
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.760
OK yeah.

b7c96f24-22f0-440d-949d-1d2665786208-0
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:41.706
So like this is a, you know,
a 48 by 48 inch diameter by, you know,

b7c96f24-22f0-440d-949d-1d2665786208-1
00:28:41.706 --> 00:28:44.800
72 inch tall or whatever it is.

5ca20067-a968-4df2-85c9-a3cd3838f781-0
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.920
I have no idea, but OK.

8a645235-7893-4943-a61c-5e59c0e487fe-0
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.160
Yeah.

9d6710cc-05cb-43b4-84ad-d5715058f92b-0
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:50.640
OK.

0311a331-0816-4564-9a04-88263f14ed9e-0
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.480
Is that coming from the material cost or
labour house material?

57591cfd-1c47-493e-828d-12d43e73734c-0
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.960
Can we click on the second tab which
information we're looking at here?

eb5bae16-4aa6-4737-8fe2-8d34d35690f4-0
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:02.680
Sorry.

eccfb06e-e37b-4f0d-bf5b-6007f59c097d-0
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.000
So this one you're referring right apart.

f496588d-cf30-4b93-9c98-d3c162228168-0
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.520
Apart from these three top cards that you
have document material costs and labour.

19b4ca2d-6182-4ee6-a199-3b6c79fc232c-0
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.454
Along with that,
we have another card that's basic

19b4ca2d-6182-4ee6-a199-3b6c79fc232c-1
00:29:21.454 --> 00:29:26.720
information and that chord contains
details like what's the diameter of the

19b4ca2d-6182-4ee6-a199-3b6c79fc232c-2
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.264
shell and some other maybe key pieces of
information that they need that That's

19b4ca2d-6182-4ee6-a199-3b6c79fc232c-3
00:29:32.264 --> 00:29:32.680
right.

503a3fb7-ce4f-411a-af8a-bf4b3c193bf9-0
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.908
So, yeah, the diameter and the,
the shell height so that we can see

503a3fb7-ce4f-411a-af8a-bf4b3c193bf9-1
00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:40.080
roughly what size of vessel we're looking
at here.

813d07aa-75ff-4f67-9bfe-e4e64a296b9b-0
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.240
Because I, I,
you're just looking at these line items.

7478c751-5e0c-4ccc-96b8-8e30732e5e97-0
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.380
I don't know automatically what's the
diameter of the tank or how many shell

7478c751-5e0c-4ccc-96b8-8e30732e5e97-1
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.240
forces I'm going to need just, you know,
to sort of calibrate it in my head.

5d419a28-3251-4905-941c-665b6eee9876-0
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.569
Yeah, 'cause we're going to be, you know,
kind of checking on this and to have to

5d419a28-3251-4905-941c-665b6eee9876-1
00:29:56.569 --> 00:29:58.000
go in and dig to get it.

1dd2a9be-2753-4d9b-bf26-7ad14d14b2b3-0
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.840
You know, we can do it,
but it'd be much easier if it was just a

1dd2a9be-2753-4d9b-bf26-7ad14d14b2b3-1
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.080
card.

11d58b29-e5ef-4357-8ea6-02b073336aac-0
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.160
And really that would be it.

382ab6fb-02d2-4ca8-9dfd-4dca8c03c101-0
00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.440
It's just kind of shell height,
shell diameter would really get it there.

e6da142b-def4-47fa-befa-ee9fedde8acd-0
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.320
Yeah.

b83c9fd2-ac76-4e3b-a874-4126e3348a18-0
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.313
So we we can we can add one more card on
the top, let's say,

b83c9fd2-ac76-4e3b-a874-4126e3348a18-1
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:17.360
I would say summary right before the
document.

89f9d348-020f-418b-9e59-7d0f4a06df94-0
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.240
And we see all those 7 five to six
attributes and then we go into a document.

3e23f1b9-8ee7-48da-964c-5857efedc769-0
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.080
Is that helpful?

9a7fe85d-cbc8-4117-a8ee-5c5ba5007e03-0
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.080
Where where where you got a little block?

5d090367-8f42-4927-95e0-7f9b00fe4a81-0
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.080
It says note right there.

3062d557-6b3b-4b0f-97ed-ad9c1b638aaf-0
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.502
That where it says note, note, block,
just put, you know,

3062d557-6b3b-4b0f-97ed-ad9c1b638aaf-1
00:30:34.502 --> 00:30:37.400
summary or something like that.

86e82455-d818-4124-8153-bd75651713b1-0
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.120
I mean that that's where we probably see
it.

5194c7b6-5a15-4629-ad48-bf42faceddfe-0
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.360
Yeah, just size.

a3e36d38-5d85-4b16-b768-dc7eed12f203-0
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.200
Size, really.

b760f7d3-0dbd-4586-a3ec-e884385c9c82-0
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.600
Size.

3f3b3179-8433-412f-9dd2-79d3e5952eb2-0
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.960
Yeah, size.

cd39356f-0d5c-48ee-b42d-faffd48019e9-0
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:43.520
Perfect.

40969ddd-a675-4cce-9458-6e94d26cb8f1-0
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.680
OK, fine.

29156071-7fdc-4ab2-9d71-56d7b5d2ddc2-0
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.720
Because we want to see that size all the
time.

3f5bc593-f358-4976-a40b-6a3576ced532-0
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.400
Yeah.

26232e1a-fd63-47e2-a4b8-97425c4f9b53-0
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.148
You understand that We got output
diameter,

26232e1a-fd63-47e2-a4b8-97425c4f9b53-1
00:30:54.148 --> 00:30:56.120
then she'll hide all those stuff.

95580420-b723-4ea1-b3fd-07c85fd91f7d-0
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:56.360
OK.

a088a780-1f6b-4f23-b127-2ef42b0a3455-0
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:56.920
Got it.

069db56c-bc5a-46b9-bb0c-1f2f987f8ddd-0
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.000
And so we we are expecting that
information anyway.

02bbcb3e-297c-4be6-b0ca-723bfb089477-0
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.320
We just need to present.

57f3895f-d345-49cb-95eb-526de351f93b-0
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.680
Yeah, we have it already.

cd8b5fa6-a7c5-4935-9cfe-f3e95470e9a2-0
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.800
Just need to escalate them.

28a01e23-5622-4508-8fc0-91306013b155-0
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.520
Fine.

a1d1dbe4-7a5d-4a41-8e0e-e487a444c5b5-0
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.120
We just need to display it.

aacb89b9-5a1b-4213-853b-d019cfa49b8b-0
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.360
OK.

c5141c2e-fa06-4ef9-8852-88be4f0a70a1-0
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.920
So this is this is for Amit to take
action.

3397e3dc-8781-4d16-ae5b-043c0ba530a8-0
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.320
Yeah.

bef8f8e1-4550-4ca3-999a-a7c9ee18107f-0
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.560
Yeah, sure.

c465d5b6-01fe-4a41-a16f-9821d417a8fb-0
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:12.960
So.

6999eb3f-45d4-4fd3-a543-3da109532add-0
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.885
All right, on the rim angle,
I can see that we've got like a little

6999eb3f-45d4-4fd3-a543-3da109532add-1
00:31:16.885 --> 00:31:17.200
input.

e183c410-1729-4f5b-a4ee-cf2ef8421b31-0
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.960
This is here made from 220 foot angles,
which is great.

77ec720d-e09c-4ba7-8cdd-e61de7779571-0
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.589
OK, so that tells us, you know,
we're going to need to buy 220 foot

77ec720d-e09c-4ba7-8cdd-e61de7779571-1
00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:28.760
pieces of three sixteenths 2 by 2 angle.

a9637924-7f07-4a27-9b75-b3261a7a9b9f-0
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:34.160
The the length is kind of you know, well,
so 220 foot if it's correct for that.

9c118adb-6542-4ae4-9144-e14b11f0d075-0
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.080
That's exactly right.

2fc7aa81-7e68-405f-a7a1-39dea8338b8e-0
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.906
What about for like, you know,
if the top or the bottom need to be made

2fc7aa81-7e68-405f-a7a1-39dea8338b8e-1
00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:44.754
of, you know,
two different size plates or something

2fc7aa81-7e68-405f-a7a1-39dea8338b8e-2
00:31:44.754 --> 00:31:45.480
like that?

e1a84356-4f07-4817-9142-6380644bad1d-0
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.122
Do we have a,
a functionality that that's working yet

e1a84356-4f07-4817-9142-6380644bad1d-1
00:31:50.122 --> 00:31:55.746
on how to determine, you know,
what combination of plates we need in

e1a84356-4f07-4817-9142-6380644bad1d-2
00:31:55.746 --> 00:31:58.600
order to make up a given component?

a6371791-8a72-4173-a6e1-e7f6e2c7de29-0
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.082
Not, not yet, not yet,
but that is something we have in our

a6371791-8a72-4173-a6e1-e7f6e2c7de29-1
00:32:03.082 --> 00:32:03.520
backlog.

ec8a1bb9-7cfb-4318-a869-636ead355ec0-0
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.419
And Jitendra did mention to me,
not yesterday,

ec8a1bb9-7cfb-4318-a869-636ead355ec0-1
00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:10.040
but day before yesterday that this is 1
item we need to calculate.

446b630b-2b94-4b2a-8953-9218794e832d-0
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.960
Yeah, but we haven't done that at,
at the moment.

7944dca5-7799-4e76-a639-08f89adff171-0
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.323
But we know that at at at some stage we
need to work out that what,

7944dca5-7799-4e76-a639-08f89adff171-1
00:32:17.323 --> 00:32:18.800
what do we need, right?

f4499b62-e66e-48a3-8221-5e643600b19f-0
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.120
Can we prioritize that also now, Shakti?

ba127cca-de54-4996-8f99-29b72361a9e4-0
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:24.400
Yep.

d9be9633-d837-4288-afd4-9ffa87e75c0f-0
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.480
OK, fine.

f8eecae3-359a-4794-b1cd-6c4253ff7adb-0
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.462
So Jitendra,
let's let's take that item as well in

f8eecae3-359a-4794-b1cd-6c4253ff7adb-1
00:32:28.462 --> 00:32:29.680
this equation working.

1288267c-bed3-42e0-a7f7-890394e94685-0
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.120
Yeah.

115eeea6-9ad3-4b7e-9e3c-59a5079a399e-0
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:36.920
That's gonna need to be working for this
document for this for for this tank.

13cd2600-4cee-4bd3-b7ec-2e7da38d0262-0
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.880
Yeah, be correct.

d1fb4147-7007-433f-be29-2d8a8d2476ad-0
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:39.920
That needs to work.

4b85a888-1220-43f4-96e9-1585ee98bbde-0
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.320
OK, OK.

7a11e170-14a9-4145-8b5f-57bf9bfd4ce5-0
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.236
And on that as I have just mentioned
earlier,

7a11e170-14a9-4145-8b5f-57bf9bfd4ce5-1
00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:50.913
like we are waiting for the response from
Chris so that we should have that

7a11e170-14a9-4145-8b5f-57bf9bfd4ce5-2
00:32:50.913 --> 00:32:56.964
calculation and based on that we could
build the logic for some of the component

7a11e170-14a9-4145-8b5f-57bf9bfd4ce5-3
00:32:56.964 --> 00:32:59.280
show the made from information.

f3b26dbd-c082-4867-bfa3-c6d60a1eead5-0
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.920
Sorry,
you're waiting on Chris for something.

029eb5da-a1ec-43dd-8ab8-c88d1300ff58-0
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.880
Yes, yes.

da7a030a-f875-4310-ad06-5d9213412e8f-0
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:05.800
What?

20ad2e0b-ff8a-4e5c-907d-f8327e25e773-0
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.480
So he has made some information.

88fab490-e17e-4d55-a0b4-dde4268d389b-0
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.400
So for some of the no,
I'm not buying that.

0d76efad-1f52-4c18-a7c3-0e47e8c16813-0
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.760
OK, I'm not buying that.

77175585-1781-4ac3-b67f-461cd89403c6-0
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:22.552
So we have told you that we need this,
I'll call it algorithm or routine or

77175585-1781-4ac3-b67f-461cd89403c6-1
00:33:22.552 --> 00:33:24.160
whatever for weeks.

4fb4fe6a-6e2a-43d1-a95d-c9e50b8b67d9-0
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.040
So don't tell me now that you're waiting
on us.

b1413f8e-260d-4e09-ad20-cc8f16a7227c-0
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.224
Actually, we're waiting on you, Yes,
but for some of the for weeks of Jay,

b1413f8e-260d-4e09-ad20-cc8f16a7227c-1
00:33:37.224 --> 00:33:41.200
don't tell me that you don't know what
you're.

37ebfe02-d0d0-4119-900a-56861607dc4f-0
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.400
If you haven't had time to do it,
then make the time.

454b046a-c89d-4247-a575-83874a680143-0
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.642
Yeah,
but I think he's looking for the

454b046a-c89d-4247-a575-83874a680143-1
00:33:50.642 --> 00:33:51.560
information, David.

b21570a2-0adf-4cce-8028-55aa71de3a0e-0
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.680
So we discussed.

fcc6255d-ebb2-437e-86df-4cc031511f94-0
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.440
Yeah.

3d6be9f1-ec86-40df-9fa4-9aa6c1fb7842-0
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.120
OK.

78f6efca-2c4b-4197-95bd-2c37105dc49b-0
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.400
No, we take the mutual website.

82627c12-b099-4b1d-8915-27ed40486042-0
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.480
We've actually,
you probably don't know this.

504dd562-cdfc-47b4-9b12-33a86589fac3-0
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.480
We've actually even taken the team to a
website where it does this already.

1d45249b-7fd3-4e9f-b1df-6378078fa305-0
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.079
We've done this, yes,
but for in that scenario,

1d45249b-7fd3-4e9f-b1df-6378078fa305-1
00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:15.960
why are we still waiting for this?

ff0c2a7f-5ca9-4cdf-98eb-a651c8057735-0
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.595
Yes, in that scenario,
what we have mentioned is the website is

ff0c2a7f-5ca9-4cdf-98eb-a651c8057735-1
00:34:21.595 --> 00:34:26.080
not something where we could fetch the
information on rely on.

e107df32-441f-4378-ac20-b027ec6bb3fe-0
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:31.280
Because if website is not working,
then the system will not work in that way,

e107df32-441f-4378-ac20-b027ec6bb3fe-1
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.680
right?

b2c58deb-6682-464b-a132-2643fe0c95b0-0
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.665
So what I, we have asked to please,
please provide us that calculation

b2c58deb-6682-464b-a132-2643fe0c95b0-1
00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:42.011
details in a table format so that we
could build or implement that logic from

b2c58deb-6682-464b-a132-2643fe0c95b0-2
00:34:42.011 --> 00:34:42.560
our end.

0edeedaf-a1ed-42f3-a645-072fd699e4db-0
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.560
No, no, you've got it all wrong.

66e97dc5-b299-493e-bd8e-00a9ac97367d-0
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.640
You're asking us to do your work for you.

0e4a5e86-898a-4991-b967-a0c3c428bdc2-0
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.600
It's backwards.

1681dea2-abb6-4660-ba01-4663b4376ff2-0
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.080
You guys need to figure this out and it's
not hard.

f5b43ce6-8bfc-474a-ac05-7f65a53fcdbf-0
00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.140
We are talking,
let's suppose for a particular component,

f5b43ce6-8bfc-474a-ac05-7f65a53fcdbf-1
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:05.720
if we need to know from where we will
calculate the made from details.

8fa46883-bcf2-4d19-a607-123a06c0ed96-0
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.960
OK, now for that there is certain rule,
right?

4a16a8db-ac0c-4169-9a48-e00f01b68d31-0
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.852
Yes, in a particular call,
Chris has shared a particular website

4a16a8db-ac0c-4169-9a48-e00f01b68d31-1
00:35:12.852 --> 00:35:14.840
from where we get that information.

4ff8672c-68e9-4876-a8e7-909a574fd037-0
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.000
But after that we agreed upon like Greece
will share that information.

8802d15c-460a-4d6a-b5a1-7e20db527414-0
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:26.360
Based on that we will build the logic and
then showcase the mid form information.

89476d4e-a0d3-49c0-a82d-b29d6b802cd2-0
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.709
Even in the last week we have connected
with Greece and we agreed upon the same

89476d4e-a0d3-49c0-a82d-b29d6b802cd2-1
00:35:33.709 --> 00:35:34.560
information.

21b7ce02-f855-4296-8ae1-2831f12b19bd-0
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.240
Yeah.

70327893-ac50-4600-bd1b-b4a838b041d5-0
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.506
But my understanding was you just needed
to know the available plate sizes,

70327893-ac50-4600-bd1b-b4a838b041d5-1
00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:43.240
which is on, you know, the shared folder.

27d9622b-4822-41f0-b007-f5ba6ff63ffc-0
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.951
Sorry, Chris is saying, yeah,
Chris is saying sorry that we just need

27d9622b-4822-41f0-b007-f5ba6ff63ffc-1
00:35:51.951 --> 00:35:57.819
to know the available plate size and that
information is available on the folder

27d9622b-4822-41f0-b007-f5ba6ff63ffc-2
00:35:57.819 --> 00:36:03.108
and we need to calculate, right,
the size from that source that we don't

27d9622b-4822-41f0-b007-f5ba6ff63ffc-3
00:36:03.108 --> 00:36:04.919
need to do anything else.

e191d250-f2f8-4b4b-b9f3-99f0dbfe55bf-0
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.800
And the let's say, yeah,
for some of the component we have done

e191d250-f2f8-4b4b-b9f3-99f0dbfe55bf-1
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.160
that, let's suppose for the shell.

0733b8e0-bfd5-47f5-851d-979e95c256f7-0
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.400
So we have killed the lot.

e8f785be-3422-43b0-84ef-16b7a3356c94-0
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.760
We have already built the logic.

ec69d4a6-fc4f-411f-aaa5-cc25e630bf98-0
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.638
So from the design calculation we will
get the thickness and the quantity like

ec69d4a6-fc4f-411f-aaa5-cc25e630bf98-1
00:36:20.638 --> 00:36:22.800
quantity and then width and length.

2d3dd1fa-1718-4936-9396-89bb7fb4d7fa-0
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.720
We have already built the logic and you
can see the information on the front end.

cf7c980f-9902-48b5-9105-63bf43ae5f94-0
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.000
So that is not an issue.

bc88c72a-741c-4df4-afb4-63faa70301a0-0
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.481
So whichever component is known and
whichever component the information is

bc88c72a-741c-4df4-afb4-63faa70301a0-1
00:36:34.481 --> 00:36:37.501
available,
let's let's work on that part and share

bc88c72a-741c-4df4-afb4-63faa70301a0-2
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:42.120
the information that for specific this
area, we don't have the detail, right?

4c2439cb-4abd-45fa-943b-572953e748c9-0
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.554
So let's look at that properly because in
last two to four week,

4c2439cb-4abd-45fa-943b-572953e748c9-1
00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:46.880
we haven't done that area.

b2133fe7-ceb9-496d-88f1-e39dcd46f29c-0
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.480
Let's look at the information what we
have, right?

93a51e31-575b-44f7-a539-1ed5cb4fd0c1-0
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.000
And then we go back to Chris, right?

a2ab23bd-b5d6-4c48-bac8-08911891127a-0
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.280
I don't think we need to spend any other
time on that area.

8a4c15a5-4b06-4234-b248-68165efc9bae-0
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.360
OK, OK, OK.

54523124-dbc4-4c50-a5da-c0f56d89c443-0
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.160
So let us look at David, the information,
what we have the information that you

54523124-dbc4-4c50-a5da-c0f56d89c443-1
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.000
provided, right?

49c3f29a-f152-4716-af7b-f3608e78f05e-0
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.970
And if it is available and the formula is
there,

49c3f29a-f152-4716-af7b-f3608e78f05e-1
00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.760
we'll just verify and we implement the
logic.

5e9302d9-a9c0-46b1-b9ac-447a1c5c7f33-0
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.920
Yeah, that sounds good.

2a49719d-8d61-417b-bf74-e4b948e53c93-0
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:13.440
Yeah.

435334bb-322b-4745-a160-8a1ff652a942-0
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.882
And there there's, you know,
more than one place where there's just

435334bb-322b-4745-a160-8a1ff652a942-1
00:37:17.882 --> 00:37:21.152
there's a website that we go to all the
time for this,

435334bb-322b-4745-a160-8a1ff652a942-2
00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:24.720
but there's more than one website out
there that does this.

ee865b50-9676-4b42-b45a-78a8a2fb984b-0
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.531
It's it's not,
we're not asking you to invent this for

ee865b50-9676-4b42-b45a-78a8a2fb984b-1
00:37:27.531 --> 00:37:28.200
the first time.

8f9d1951-9bd2-41ea-af03-c3aff37907c5-0
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:29.560
Yep.

9b9f30d5-b8f3-4220-b656-fa9f4c3c956b-0
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.360
OK.

c48b6dbd-c540-449b-a11a-8f9b5a2c5d6b-0
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.990
OK.

487d4b9d-a275-4831-af21-57cb014976c1-0
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.150
Anything else we need to catch up today?

e282e51f-dd2c-41f5-a8f5-b82eeae18c72-0
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.550
No, nothing new.

6321d1f7-87ac-4b52-bc6e-94dbad79518a-0
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.000
No, please.

449b7026-53b4-45a3-b778-78044f6a8552-0
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.240
Sure.

7be1765b-c4f3-4fe0-9c00-cb353923ff74-0
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.920
Tell whatever we are seeing is like
correct.

c5c26405-6545-4f2f-8d42-9602a815a4cb-0
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.560
Like because I'm seeing like different
material for the shell 304.

c37ebb25-ccf2-48be-a8b0-1433e21998ee-0
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.656
We're going to have to go through it and
tell them what's everything that's wrong,

c37ebb25-ccf2-48be-a8b0-1433e21998ee-1
00:37:55.656 --> 00:37:55.880
right?

c0ffeb01-dc39-4564-8166-941206f18454-0
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.040
That's what we're going to have to do.

a9c14c0f-5154-4e2b-af21-78b1dfa756c6-0
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:57.520
That's next.

7539c791-1212-4065-b62b-5dda76737b51-0
00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.160
It's wrong.

8d64744e-4ef0-410f-bc34-fc774069375d-0
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.120
Calculation doesn't have two material,
right.

db55adec-6ec9-4f31-a2f2-58a12df83210-0
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.600
Should not be material correct in the
calculation.

e8a01d0f-71fb-40b9-a82a-ce352aa4e065-0
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:03.880
So.

a3ad584a-4b85-450f-8ac0-0dcd54b27d20-0
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.480
So we just tell them that it's wrong and
then we'll figure out where.

11d1a622-02f9-42a8-972a-7e8f9cfc674e-0
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:07.800
Oh, yeah.

e8b8771d-923d-4cf8-8e91-666d002b0f2f-0
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.080
OK.

0b647ddb-5f52-4174-bc81-1c237fb92f87-0
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.600
Yeah, yeah.

d7f31ab7-e6d3-492b-9686-83b9866a57bd-0
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.560
So at least now we're seeing something.

f9fedcbc-367c-4ecb-99e2-920e84adbea1-0
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.440
Yep, right,
which is like a big step forward, OK.

51bedcca-9455-4cbc-9d64-85eeaae34ee3-0
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.760
It's a big step forward, yeah.

b867d9c4-1d20-4e11-a5bd-25b1da69bc07-0
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.680
And the team has done a good job to get
us this stage, right.

945d481b-17cf-40b7-826d-2b4ce9b3b5e5-0
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.640
So initial checking has, yeah.

1d6093e6-dfd6-4e25-9683-7cb00e9eda6c-0
00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.680
So Nick, initial checking has been done,
right, But we haven't done.

d2a70f22-9ca8-4de6-84e2-863e4657fb9c-0
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.806
I would say there's a difference between
how we check it,

d2a70f22-9ca8-4de6-84e2-863e4657fb9c-1
00:38:30.806 --> 00:38:34.320
because we check it from the technical
side and logical side.

b22d0199-957b-4542-ba52-94a261c57d25-0
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.630
And since we are not in the industry and
not doing this work day-to-day,

b22d0199-957b-4542-ba52-94a261c57d25-1
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:42.670
it will be difficult right for us to
confirm that whether this is correct or

b22d0199-957b-4542-ba52-94a261c57d25-2
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.880
not.

d7c6b599-c59a-4a1f-9166-54e4f0df1516-0
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.585
So that's where right this phase comes
that as a user let's if Chris is doing

d7c6b599-c59a-4a1f-9166-54e4f0df1516-1
00:38:48.585 --> 00:38:51.986
your work,
then he can look at maybe his material

d7c6b599-c59a-4a1f-9166-54e4f0df1516-2
00:38:51.986 --> 00:38:55.999
code, his labour hours,
something is not adding up, right.

a8c3a054-ad7d-472e-8be0-143cce6e0e8d-0
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.000
Raise the flag and then we can look at in
the detail that what exactly go need.

473be5e7-a0be-4e58-8951-ad022611bb69-0
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.328
Maybe there is a some required change in
the data pricing calculation,

473be5e7-a0be-4e58-8951-ad022611bb69-1
00:39:05.328 --> 00:39:09.393
something will come up or maybe we need
to fix it from over side right,

473be5e7-a0be-4e58-8951-ad022611bb69-2
00:39:09.393 --> 00:39:10.239
whatever it is.

a009304a-c99c-4423-b4de-2b47d45e31f0-0
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.360
Yeah, yeah.

1c2b8114-49d4-43eb-8a29-fe6153d0f3ef-0
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.369
So last week,
me and the team got together on Friday,

1c2b8114-49d4-43eb-8a29-fe6153d0f3ef-1
00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:17.602
I think it was,
and we looked at the example that we used

1c2b8114-49d4-43eb-8a29-fe6153d0f3ef-2
00:39:17.602 --> 00:39:18.160
last week.

08b6590a-4f37-4b46-b81f-3b7bae4db2b2-0
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.320
It was 1015 minutes.

8029f397-12af-4c63-a405-e98a4df63467-0
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.800
We pointed out the mistakes and they
figured out where the issues were.

a94fb91c-d529-454b-9e31-d7d6ce28404c-0
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.960
So we're just gonna have to, yeah,
we'll just keep happy going through that.

3af18c62-62b6-46fb-8ee4-1d0e002227b7-0
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.160
That's an expected part of the process.

4069036b-75f7-41f4-a37e-8f56e0d440dc-0
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.289
I'm just,
I'm very pleased actually to correct this

4069036b-75f7-41f4-a37e-8f56e0d440dc-1
00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:33.480
thing.

19b1f0e1-03ac-455b-bbdc-772268f74e06-0
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.000
Yeah.

ac74d39f-911b-4142-a4a1-276605356800-0
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.290
I thought like, you know,
there they can map 70% of the component

ac74d39f-911b-4142-a4a1-276605356800-1
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:38.640
or 50%.

bfdd5e19-0e2d-4db7-8aa9-9f0f124b8f35-0
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.280
I don't see like 70% output on the on the
estimate.

506cae25-59a5-47aa-af1b-5d84b29a101c-0
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.640
That's what my, you know.

cb1a8d64-765f-4f66-928f-67235416c474-0
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.440
Thank you.

954efde2-22af-4142-8e18-11b9d141a160-0
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.800
It looks like it's 5 or 10% output or 10%
mapping from the calculation.

9beaf403-f9d2-4f42-ae06-b592e331a522-0
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.240
Yeah, maybe 40%, but yeah, not 100.

259086e3-413b-4135-b9d2-9c139ca9a811-0
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.960
Yeah, because there's no nozzles,
there's no band move on there.

1c5e0771-db78-4cf7-be1a-51e8ee09d8ba-0
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.200
Yeah.

db66d263-95fa-45e4-a7c2-c563b3213fda-0
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.018
So we got, yeah,
so we got some things to do, but yeah,

db66d263-95fa-45e4-a7c2-c563b3213fda-1
00:39:58.018 --> 00:40:01.359
but yeah,
so at least there's something there to

db66d263-95fa-45e4-a7c2-c563b3213fda-2
00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:03.200
comment on, which is great.

dcc7ce85-6640-4153-9afa-1cd0fcda2ec8-0
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.800
OK, Yeah.

b0949d38-2cf7-4533-adb2-bb16faff4a4e-0
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.600
OK, good.

52fd53e6-25cf-4b9e-82ed-836c9ceebb6b-0
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.143
So we will share the e-mail and along
with that last week itself,

52fd53e6-25cf-4b9e-82ed-836c9ceebb6b-1
00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.600
I have shared that week start guide.

28810724-6f6a-4a16-8d22-6777e7cbdffa-0
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.745
So I will again share that so that you
guys have that idea how to use the

28810724-6f6a-4a16-8d22-6777e7cbdffa-1
00:40:19.745 --> 00:40:22.040
application just for a big guide.

82867e81-b6a3-4dcc-b878-d8b4ec401914-0
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.000
Yep, great.

d7b8ff00-cb9c-495e-b890-76e4db0665a2-0
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.240
Thank you.

b0da9006-e464-45a8-b90c-ea60bb1d6c9b-0
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:28.880
Thank you guys.

c431c3af-ffe5-4c14-8073-ac96851e9df5-0
00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.160
Thank you.

a264f9b7-ef22-417e-9fda-44d7f1999fc8-0
00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.040
Bye.

c11dbdfc-810c-4d51-95d2-a91da812382e-0
00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.200
Bye work.

e2937525-3f69-48fb-bdf0-d38e5c27de56-0
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.040
OK, OK, bye for now.

d3c83112-80e3-450b-98a1-52d504effc67-0
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:36.360
Bye.
